Task 1:
The countDown function outputs "..." for n amount of times until 0 is reached. Once 0 is reached, "Blastoff!" is printed.
The time complexity is linear as it recursively calls itself n amount of times.

Task 2:
Check Task2.java code

Task 3:
The time complexity is exponential O(2^n) as each recursive call will branch to two new cases
As such, each step will have 2^n calls (1st step - 2^0 = 1;   2nd step - 2^1 = 2;   3rd step - 2^2 =4 ...)
This will continue until the base cases are reached which is 2^n steps
